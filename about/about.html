                                    My name is Chris Johnson and I was born in Denver, Co but have lived on four different 
                                    continents. I have lived in the United States for most of my life but I do love 
                                    to travel and will continue in the future. I recently graduated from MSU but it has 
                                    been a fairly unlucky time but I have been able to spend a lot of time developing my 
                                    programming skills. I am currently living in lakewood, Co but I am looking for new 
                                    opportunities and I am willing to relocate should an opportunity arise.

                                    I recently graduated from MSU Denver with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
                                    I plan on persuing a masters degree at CU Denver but I want to get some experience in 
                                    a professional environemnt in the mean time. My main language has been Java but I 
                                    also studied Python, Kotlin, SQL and Machine Learning.

                                    One of my favorite things as of late has been bike riding. I ride a lot 
                                    of trails in wheatridge and am looking for some more. I also like to play 
                                    video games which has motivated me to learn about augmented reality so I can 
                                    develop a game using AR(Current Project). I suppose I also like to travel 
                                    but that is a fairly common hobbie. My last trip was to Hanoi in vietnam 
                                    where I explored the city and made some great friends. I would love to go 
                                    back but I want to travel to somewhere new next.

                                    There are a few different projects that I am working on at the moment with this 
                                    website being one of them. I started this website because I wanted to learn Web 
                                    development whihc is going well but I am finding that I am spending more time learning 
                                    about graphic design than I would hav thought. My next project involves creating an android 
                                    application using kotlin and Google's ARcore. I want to start with a game but I have a 
                                    few other ideas for it as well. Most of My projects can be found on github but my kotlin 
                                    application project may be private at least until i have a basic framework built.
